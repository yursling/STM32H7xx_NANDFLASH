# STM32H7xx_NANDFLASH
This is a driver for the WT29F4G08ABADA NAND flash memory, implemented on the STM32H723 microcontroller using the HAL library. The specific function usage is detailed in the header file. After testing, it has been confirmed that the driver can perform read and write operations at any location, but it does not include an ECC (Error Correction Code) mechanism.

Key Features:
Hardware Platform: STM32H723 microcontroller.

NAND Flash: WT29F4G08ABADA.

Library: STM32 HAL library LL library

Functionality:

Supports arbitrary location read/write operations.

No ECC mechanism implemented (error correction is not handled).

Testing: The driver has been tested and verified for basic read/write functionality.

Notes:
The driver is designed for basic NAND flash operations and can be extended to include additional features such as ECC, wear leveling, or bad block management if required.

For further improvements, consider implementing ECC to enhance data reliability, especially for long-term usage or in environments prone to bit errors.
